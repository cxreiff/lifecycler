# lifecycler

[_bevy game jam #5 submission_](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-5)

## installation

If you have [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) installed, you can simply run the following:

```sh
cargo install lifecycler
```

Alternatively you can manually download an executable from the itch.io page.

## play

To launch the game:

```sh
lifecycler
```

If you manually installed the executable, you will have to include the path (e.g. `./lifecycler` if in the same directory).

## compatibility

This requires that your terminal:

1. Supports 24bit color.
2. Has reasonably efficient rendering.

This includes a decent variety of terminals, but I have personally confirmed good results in the following:

- Alacritty
- Kitty
- WezTerm
- iTerm2
